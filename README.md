# TapForMelody

Tap for Melody is an app which allows You to play, record and listen to your own melodies BUT! what is even more fascinating You can check if You played something famous and widely known.
After You record something just save it in the local database.
For every melody, either custom one or library one, simply tap melody on list and check what notes it contains.
